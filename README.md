# What is Flutter? ðŸ¤”

Flutter is a free and open-source mobile UI framework created by Google and released in May 2017. In a few words, it allows you to create a native mobile application with only one codebase. This means that you can use one programming language and one codebase to create two different apps (for iOS and Android).

Flutter consists of two important parts. The first one is  An SDK (Software Development Kit). It's a collection of tools that are going to help you develop your applications. This includes tools to compile your code into native machine code (code for iOS and Android). Second, A Framework (UI Library based on widgets). It's a collection of reusable UI elements (buttons, text inputs, sliders, and so on) that you can personalize for your own needs.

Flutter use Dart as the programming language. The language was created by Google in October 2011, but it has improved a lot over these past years. Dart focuses on front-end development, and you can use it to create mobile and web applications. If you know a bit of programming, Dart is a typed object programming language. You can compare Dart's syntax to JavaScript.

# Why we have to learn Flutter? ðŸ˜®

First, Flutter is very easy to use. Especially to person who have used used Javascript, Swift, or React Native, you'll notice how Flutter is different. One of the advantages by using flutter is you can create a real native application without a bunch of code. Second, it is a growing community. Third, Flutter supported by VS Code and Android Studio. Android Studio is a complete software with everything already integrated. You have to download Flutter and Dart plugins to start. VS Code is a lightweight tool, and everything is configurable through plugins from the marketplace. Fourth, Flutter has good documentation. Because it was a new technology, have good documentation is a must.
