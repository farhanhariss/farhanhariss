# What is Flutter? ðŸ¤”

Flutter consists of two important parts. The first one is  An SDK (Software Development Kit). It's a collection of tools that are going to help you develop your applications. This includes tools to compile your code into native machine code (code for iOS and Android). Second, A Framework (UI Library based on widgets). It's a collection of reusable UI elements (buttons, text inputs, sliders, and so on) that you can personalize for your own needs. 

Flutter use Dart as the programming language. The language was created by Google in October 2011, but it has improved a lot over these past years. Dart focuses on front-end development, and you can use it to create mobile and web applications. If you know a bit of programming, Dart is a typed object programming language. You can compare Dart's syntax to JavaScript.
