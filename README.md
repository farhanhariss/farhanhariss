# What is Flutter ? ðŸ¤”
    Flutter is a free and open-source mobile UI framework created by Google and released in May 2017. In a few words, it allows you to create a native mobile application with only one codebase. This means that you can use one programming language and one codebase to create two different apps (for iOS and Android).

    Flutter consists of two important parts. The first one is  An SDK (Software Development Kit). It's a collection of tools that are going to help you develop your applications. This includes tools to compile your code into native machine code (code for iOS and Android). Second, A Framework (UI Library based on widgets). It's a collection of reusable UI elements (buttons, text inputs, sliders, and so on) that you can personalize for your own needs.
